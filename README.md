# Home_Base
A notion-like desktop homepage more streamlined and personalized for me with the features I want to see when I turn on my PC.

## Plan
- Most if not all functions on one page/screen
- Implement Spotify API
- To-Do List
- Sticky Notes / Temp Notes (Auto-Delete ater x time)
- Audio Visualizations for Currently Playing
- Hobby Trackers (Exercise, Books, Projects)
- Noise Creator (White, Brown, Nature)

## Optionals
- Option to extend to fit multiple screens
- Color customization / Themes / Custom Backgrounds
- Run as interactive wallpaper e.g. wallpaper engine
- Open on PC startup
- Modules can be moved around with optional "snap-to-place" grid function
- "Pets" e.g. fishtank, turtle tank, sort of like iGoogle widgets

## Libraries to Consider
- Next.js
- MUI
